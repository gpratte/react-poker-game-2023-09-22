# React poker game
A react functional components learning application. I took just the game part of
my react application what uses class components 
[texastoc-client-v5](https://github.com/gpratte/texastoc-client-v5/tree/master/src/current-game/components)
and implemented with react functional components.

But there's more...
* react hooks (state, context, effects)
* new notification components
* typescript

At the bottom of this readme you will find a list of the branches which shows a history of the changes.

## Versions
Node version
* using node version v18.12.1 and npm version 8.19.2.

Create react app version
* _npx create-react-app --version_ spit out 5.0.1.

Create the react app with typescript
* _npx create-react-app --template typescript_

React version
* _create-react-app_ installed react version 18 (as you can see by the react version in the package.json).
